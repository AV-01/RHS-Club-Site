Learn to work with yarn! We loom-knit hats to donate to cancer patients and those in need. Join us on Wednesdays at flex for chill looming sessions, learning how to crochet, and lessons on how to make cool things! We meet in Ms. Padilla's room. Bring yarn/loom (or don't - we have some too!), a friend, and have a blast with us!
